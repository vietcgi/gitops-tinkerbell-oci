# ClusterIssuers for TLS certificates
#
# Self-signed issuer works out of the box.
# Let's Encrypt requires:
#   1. A valid email address
#   2. A public domain pointing to your cluster
#   3. Port 80 accessible for HTTP-01 challenge
#
# To enable Let's Encrypt:
#   1. Update the email addresses below
#   2. Uncomment the letsencrypt-staging issuer first
#   3. Test with staging, then switch to letsencrypt-prod
